# Web-Assessment-Amir

# What did you like about this project?
I prefer to have a template and specs to follow rather than coming up with your own design. Its easier to code that way with a mock up design with specifications.

# What did you struggle with in this project
Some of the padding/margin issues and also some flex functions which I had to google. All problems were solved through some research.

I feel that my CSS is abit messy but then again I lack knowledge of industry standards.

# What would make your experience with this assessment better?
I think the assessment is perfect in a sense that it helps to test your coding rather than design skills. My experience with this assessment is very good. Challenging but overall a good experience
